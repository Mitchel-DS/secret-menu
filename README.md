## What is this project?
This is a website for Secret Menu. It's meant to be a website where vegans (and ofcourse other users) can look for restaurants that offer vegan menu items, but it's not specifically mentioned on the menu or website. This will make it easier for people to find vegan restaurants and offer a platform where people can easily check out new places and leave reviews for other people.
